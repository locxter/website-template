# Website template

## Overview

This repository includes my personal website template.

## Dependencies

I generally try to minimize dependencies, but I'm a one man crew and can therefore only support Ubuntu as I'm running it myself. Anyway, you need to have the following packages installed for everything to work properly:

- Firefox for viewing the website. Install it with `sudo apt install firefox`.
- Gedit for editing the source code. Install it with sudo apt install gedit.
